What happens when you initialize a repository? why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository you are making a new directory or an existing one to now include a .git
	file which will contain the metadata of the history of the files in that directory. Iniatializing a repository allows
	us to be able to track changes you'll be making to your project.
How is the staging area different from the working directory? what value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is like a mid-way point between the working directory and the repository. It allows us to commit a 
	bundle of files to the repository once as a single logical change, while each file in the bundle to be committed 
	have been added one at a time to the staging area from the working directory.
