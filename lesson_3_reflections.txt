When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	when you want to share your repository with others e.g for their own contributions to your project, you would want to use a remote 
	repository rather than keeping all your work local.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up-to-dte with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually gives you control over the changes that might have been included in the repo by another user that you would like to
	include in your local repo.
Desscribe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks refers to making a copy of an online repository to your own online repo on GitHub, so you can work on it. This is done when you have no permission to
	make changes to someone's repo.
	A Clone is a copy of an entire local repository on Git. You clone a repo when you want to work on it without affecting the features or history of the 
	original.
	Branches are made on a repo to work on a new feature to be added to the repo, add documentation, or fix bugs. A branch is a label for a set of commits
	that you make.
